	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">Network.Attoparsec is a convenience library which aims to make it easy to run an attoparsec parser on top of a socket. Since attoparsec supports incremental parsing, you would normally have to figure out your own way to keep track of state, buffering, knowing when a parse is finished, knowing when to read more, etcetera. This library hides all these details from you. <a href="{{ "http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-attoparsec" }}" class="saymore">Go to package</a>

	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">Network.Anonymous.I2P is an <a href='http://geti2p.net/'>I2P</a> API for Haskell. As I personally believe that Haskell is a great language to write "secure" systems in, and lends itself perfectly for the privacy conscious developer, I needed this API for another project of mine. I developed it in around 2 weeks of time, and implemented 70 test cases to get 95% code coverage in these. Even though it is a very new library, I feel the quality of the code is reasonably mature and there are few (or perhaps no) bugs hidden in the code. <a href="{{ "http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-anonymous-i2p" }}" class="saymore">Go to package</a>

	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">libpaxos-cpp is a C++ implementation of the Paxos distributed consensus protocol, and is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license. It aims to provide the simplest interface possible and hides much of the complex, technical details. I've written it purely as a portfolio project to demonstrate my abilities with modern C++ and writing fault-tolerant distributed systems. <a href="{{ "/libpaxos-cpp" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="saymore">Read more</a>

      <p>
	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">libbackbone-cpp is a C++ implementation of a minimalist MVC framework inspired by Backbone.JS, and is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license. While Backbone.JS aims to provide a client-side MVC framework, libbackbone-cpp implements the server-side of the same concepts. The library itself is written by me because I felt myself needing a flexible MVC framework for C++ without all the overhead using such a framework might cause. As such it is a lightweight library that performs most of its logic compile-time using Boost.Fusion. <a href="{{ "/libbackbone-cpp" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="saymore">Read more</a>
