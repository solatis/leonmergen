	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">Bitcoin.Script is a library for parsing, manipulating and compiling native Bitcoin scripts. Bitcoin scripts make use of Bitcoin's <a href="{{ "hhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script" }} ">script bytecode</a>, which is represented in a binary format. This library makes heavy use of Data.Binary to serialize and deserialize these scripts into pure native Haskell objects. <a href="{{ "http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bitcoin-script" }} " class="saymore">Go to package</a>

	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">Bitcoin.Transaction is a library for parsing, manipulating and serializing Bitcoin transactions. It is able to interpret a full transaction object from Bitcoin's <a href="{{ "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction" }} ">raw transaction format</a>. It makes use of the Bitcoin.Script library to automatically parse all scripts of the transaction objects, and provides you with easy to use functions to manipulate these transactions. This library is specifically useful if you want to create complex transactions, since this is not supported by Bitcoin's RPC API. <a href="{{ "http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bitcoin-script" }} " class="saymore">Go to package</a>

	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">Network.Attoparsec is a convenience library which aims to make it easy to run an attoparsec parser on top of a socket. Since attoparsec supports incremental parsing, you would normally have to figure out your own way to keep track of state, buffering, knowing when a parse is finished, knowing when to read more, etcetera. This library hides all these details from you. <a href="{{ "http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-attoparsec" }}" class="saymore">Go to package</a>

      <p>
	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">Network.Anonymous.I2P is an <a href='http://geti2p.net/'>I2P</a> API for Haskell. As I personally believe that Haskell is a great language to write "secure" systems in, and lends itself perfectly for the privacy conscious developer, I needed this API for another project of mine. I developed it in around 2 weeks of time, and implemented 70 test cases to get 95% code coverage in these. Even though it is a very new library, I feel the quality of the code is reasonably mature and there are few (or perhaps no) bugs hidden in the code. <a href="{{ "http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-anonymous-i2p" }}" class="saymore">Go to package</a>

	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">libpaxos-cpp is a C++ implementation of the Paxos distributed consensus protocol, and is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license. It aims to provide the simplest interface possible and hides much of the complex, technical details. I've written it purely as a portfolio project to demonstrate my abilities with modern C++ and writing fault-tolerant distributed systems. <a href="{{ "/libpaxos-cpp" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="saymore">Read more</a>

      <p>
	<img src="images/settings.png" class="pics" alt="">libbackbone-cpp is a C++ implementation of a minimalist MVC framework inspired by Backbone.JS, and is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license. While Backbone.JS aims to provide a client-side MVC framework, libbackbone-cpp implements the server-side of the same concepts. The library itself is written by me because I felt myself needing a flexible MVC framework for C++ without all the overhead using such a framework might cause. As such it is a lightweight library that performs most of its logic compile-time using Boost.Fusion. <a href="{{ "/libbackbone-cpp" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="saymore">Read more</a>
