      <h4>All about me</h4>

    <p>
      My name is Leon Mergen and I am a software engineer, living in Cambodia since April 2014 on what started out as a sabbatical. During this time I found out that living in a country where people do not participate on <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race'>the endless rat race</a> is actually really nice, and due to the low living expenses I have been able to support myself and have enough spare time to dive into side projects just for the sake of learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before going to Cambodia I was the CTO and co-founder of an online adserving platform. I lead this business for around 8 years, during which I have learned more about what does not work than what does work: eventually I got a pretty bad burnout, figured that this was not the life I wanted, and got the opportunity to have a decent exit which left me (almost) debt-free. I stayed around the new employer for one more year, after which I packed my bags and left to Cambodia.

    <p>
      I started this website purely as a point where I can share my intelligent (ahem!) insights with the world, and as a general reference of my online persona.
