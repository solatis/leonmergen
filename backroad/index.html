            The Back Road is a group of cooperative, <br class="mobile-hide" />
            skilled CoC players.
          </p>
          <p class="style3">
            There are quite a few skilled clans in the Clash of Clans, but most
            of them have a highly competitive environment: the pressure to perform
            is huge, which in turn creates a toxic environment.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="style3">
            The Back Road is not that clan. We are built in a vision of
            <strong>cooperation</strong>, where <strong>failure is an option</strong>,
            and is even encouraged: failure is the best way to learn, if you are
            <strong>willing to learn from mistakes</strong>.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="style3">
            This clan is built by a group of people that came from top ranking
            war clans that were looking for a more cooperative environment. We
            created this environment to invite you to <strong>join us</strong>,
            <strong>learn from your mistakes</strong> and <strong>grow to the
              next level</strong>.

                      It might seem simple, but it is important: talk, talk, talk.
                      We are a clan that would like to help each other, but if you're
                      not open for conversation, there is not much we can do to
                      help.

                    <p>
                      There are actual people with feelings at the other end of
                      the connection. Be mindful of this, and don't talk to someone
                      in a way you wouldn't talk to them in real life.

                    <p>
                      Normally in clans, promotions are an honour only and don't
                      have much value. In the Back Road, however, this status has
                      actual meaning: anyone with elder status is required to
                      respond to requests for feedback from other members.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                      This gives our clan a clear structure. If you don't have
                      the time to go through someone's attack and give him/her
                      advice, don't take an elder position.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="icon fa-refresh">Learn from your mistakes</h3>
                    <p>
                      All clan elders are there to help you. When you fail in an
                      attack, you can request feedback from an elder to learn
                      why it failed and how you can improve.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                      If you are in the clan, failing repeatedly, but do not
                      invest the time to learn from your mistakes, this is not
                      the clan you want to join.

                    <p>
                      Maintaining a good clan is a mutual effort from members
                      and leaders: we do expect everyone to take their efforts
                      seriously. Use common sense and don't opt-in to war if you
                      cannot use both attacks.

                      We use various tools to support our clan, which are described
                      below. Use these properly: especially with things such as
                      ClashTools we need <strong>everyone</strong> to use it,
                      otherwise it's useless.
